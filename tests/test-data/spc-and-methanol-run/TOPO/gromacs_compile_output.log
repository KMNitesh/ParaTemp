GROMACS:      gmx grompp, VERSION 5.0.2
Executable:   /share/pkg/plumed/2.1.0/install/bin/gmx_mpi
Library dir:  /share/pkg/plumed/2.1.0/install/share/gromacs/top
Command line:
  gmx_mpi grompp -f nvt0.mdp -p ../spc-and-methanol.top -c ../spc-and-methanol.gro -n ../index.ndx -o nvt0.tpr -maxwarn 0

Generated 279 of the 1225 non-bonded parameter combinations
Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'Methanol'
Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'SOL'
Velocities were taken from a Maxwell distribution at 298 K
Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 12.00
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 1.00

NOTE 1 [file nvt0.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
